                <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
                <p>At GPEN it’s our motivation to see that people are helped motivated supported, promoted and placed on a procreative platform for the betterment of their lives, that of their families their communities and make an extension of such noble gestures towards national development in varieties, therefore we take it as a point of duty and as our motivation to watch out for human resources so that:</p>
                    <p>People become useful and live for themselves</p>
                    <p>People live up to their full potentials</p>
                    <p>People  live a life that worth it no matter what it takes</p>
                    <p>People  be explored for greatness and never exploited</p>
                    <p>People should do it themselves</p>
                    <p>People should help and assist other people and become a people(There is one human race)</p>
                    <p>People should be given a chance to life at education and at the future</p>
                    <p>People should make the world of their fantasy</p>
                    <p>People should live in peace and harmony irrespective of their belief and values</p>
                    <p>People should be happy no matter the cost actively participating in decision making</p>
                    <p>It’s not only a motivation but a passion for human race where which  every human has a role to play in the race of humanity. 
                        Haven’t known that everyone has a role to play helping someone else, all we need to do is to help one 
                        person and expecting nothing in return that is a humanitarianism and that the legacy  that stand the 
                        taste of time, it tells of a person till eternity present or absent  dead or alive even at death the 
                        humanitarian forever live in the lives of the living he lived to help make their living . 
                        In as much as people make people, so do people destroy people that the most pathetic phase of human 
                        race and that’s what has set humanity in a dilemma because people use people instead of people 
                        helping and grooming other people for greatness, the human as a free moral agent entitle to their own 
                        opinions has allowed the selfish self to suppress the selfless personality that is a major player in 
                        making things best that why for decades the human race is in a decelerating order. People will only need 
                        other people for what they want to achieve, faking sincerity to win others loyalty when the peak is 
                        reach it becomes a different story entirely and it’s the exact reason why the law of karma still 
                        exist allowing nemesis catch up its own just for a baseless quest for power, prosperity or firm but 
                        the truth remains that the most sufficient and powerful people on earth go for posterity while the 
                        weak strive for prosperity at the expense of others. Posterity make people pay a supreme price for 
                        others even with their lives but prosperity make people run helter-skelter in an effort to live 
                        again seeing no need to give in for a loss cause.</p>
                        <p>It’s with that understanding that we at Global Potentials Exploring Network come into the big picture to help address such issues so as to help people get into their said destination in life through different channels one of which is our skill acquisition and entrepreneurship training it’s a key area to which a lot of people are carried along and catered for and repositioned for their quest for greatness in life( we don’t just give people fish we teach them how to catch the fish) seeing that people need to be helped and will always need help its then devised that people be trained base on their own innate ability and skills so they can be masters of their own so it won’t be a wait and take scenario always, but at least a  do and  get scenario a joy of an independent life. who will no longer be a burden who will no longer be a reason to hide because they can survive on their own . If you give people fish they enjoy it and will happy be very happy but mind you the happiness will only last for a moment once the fish given finished so your thoughts in them finish they end up forgetting you because its temporal, it come with a joy that never last because its attached to the being of others, you begin to imagine if  they are not there what will be the fate of eaters who don’t know fishing in fact  at some point in time they will hate you for giving them the sweet taste of the fish that they never will get. Sometime some of those who are given the fish to consume might have better fishing skills than the ones who gave them the fish initially. That is why people are to be given a chance at life a chance to live for themselves, rest , relax your energy teach them so that each time they go fishing your skill impacted becomes their chant and your thoughts be their watch word, a life line for their breakthrough in the river as they fish opportunities for their living as they are continually reminded of the greatness they will ever find in you the joy that only you can give. 
                        No matter how great we grow to become our greatness is weighed by the greater people we will raise, great beget greater to becoming greatness. If you have not help someone before and you are in position to then seeing yourself as a success is a failure.
                    People will always need a push in life, so for that very reason Global Potentials Exploring Network has made it a necessity to facilitate such push that should launch people to greater heights into their next level. Every human being Has got an innate ability that need to be activated but that can only be when people are supported because it involves a series of processes which will need to be  achieved through the effort of different set of people with like mind and such people are forever remembered. Nelson Mandela will never be forgotten in the history of south Africa Martin Luther king jr., in America for making the black America live without fear or discrimination, Mary slessor who abolish  the barbaric practice of killing of twins in Nigeria. what should we then be remembered for? With good, that we help people to become great or with bad that we are the major cause people are suffering or even the ugly that we kill people ourselves, tarnish their image and terminate their destiny. Its a point of duty we’ve vowed never to relent our effort until our good is better and the best are made its our passion. Forget how people may treat you do your best at all  cost no matter what it takes to see yourself as a reason some people will want to live again our motivation is the joy of every accomplished soul.
